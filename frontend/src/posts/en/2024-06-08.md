# Vox Populi

Interesting name - voice of the people.

I have to admit, after the first evening, it's a very accurate description. There were people, and they definitely had their voices.

Compared to the feeling of playing at Trepp, playing on a separate dance floor at Seik was very pleasant. The DJ booth is slightly higher than the rest of the crowd, so there were also fewer song requests and other pretensions. Despite this, we were asked to play Pitbull 3 times. That man is doing something right.

An interesting learning experience was also the local lighting equipment and the iPad controlling it. When playing as a duo, it's nice when one person is working on the records while the other handles the lights.

A couple of mishaps did happen during those five hours. Returing to controllers and Mixxx after playing on CDJs, it's very noticeable how the time-stretch algorithms here really aren't that good.

Sometimes the transitions also relied heavily on crossfade, but there's not much else you can do with music that was recorded before computers - variable BPM.

**Happy listening!**
