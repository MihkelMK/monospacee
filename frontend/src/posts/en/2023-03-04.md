# 6ede6õrgu6idu

The party was organized by good friends Artur and Alar Rõigas. I asked where such an idea came from:

> Artur had a chance to use the space for free and we had been disappointed with Vikerpidu for a long time so we decided to throw a better party ourselves.

The crowd was thrilled, the artists were fantastic, and thus began an event series that will soon take place for the seventh time.

# Performers

## su/mi <Socials data={sumiSocials} class="inline"/>

su/mi is a found family cultivating electronic indie-pop with alternative influences, whose members are Jan Kuusemets (vocals), Eke Allikvere (keyboards, vocals, production) and Frederik Welk (lyrics, visuals).

> We are united by a shared passion and love for each other and music. Our music carries soulful and important messages, aimed at making sense of the world and making it lighter and better. In the soundscape, electropop meets dramatic piano, creating an intimate carousel of emotions.
