# Insane Summer Finale

[Saueaugu Theater](https://saueaugu.ee) had 2 productions this season. [Meeletu](https://saueaugu.ee/lavastused/meeletu) and [Kotka tee taeva all](https://saueaugu.ee/lavastused/kotka-tee-taeva-all).

All days of both performances were sold out, but people kept constantly calling and writing asking if they might somehow still fit in. So Meeletu got 2 additional performances, one between the others and another on the last day at 2 PM. After two consecutive performances, the actors still weren't done - Tobias Pilv played songs accompanied by guitar and Einar Susi hit us with some poetic rap.

After them, I, Mimmu, also had a short DJ set. Short, because everyone was completely dead from the theater season and two performances. Got to play some classics and tried some dance music I found in the summer.

# Future Technician

I helped manage lighting during the performances and set up sound in the theater hall with the local sound technician for the party. The newly acquired Shure PGXD24 SM-58 beta, first used on August 19th at Einar's first concert, worked flawlessly this time as well.  
Slowly I could even call myself a sound technician :D

If I don't find time earlier, we'll meet at the end of September at the 3rd 6ede6Ãµrgu6idu. If you can't make it, you can listen to it here as always. Until then, enjoy the end of summer and this _Meeletu_ set.

**Happy listening!**
