# 2hollis

Under today's artist introduction microscope is a 19-year-old from America, whose stage name is 2hollis.

He has released a large number of projects and singles, but became popular with his 2022 album "White Tiger" **RYM: 3.48**, which is still his most listened to album.

His unique sound is created by fast, sometimes even chaotic synthesizer melodies, which blend with hyperpop-style processed vocals and are accompanied by uptempo drums.

# 2

His newest album "2" has an RYM score of 3.41. In the songs on "2" you can often feel a strong Crystal Castles influence, where spacious drums with reverby claps and simple but massive bass create a soundscape with a very similar atmosphere.

Fun fact: I'm pretty sure there are quite a few songs that use the Minecraft firework sound effect.
